# Unit 3 Challenge: Code Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

I created this bootstrap porfolio to showcase my learning thus far and to recreate the porfolio created earlier using Flex and/or CSS grid. As I mentioned in the reading of that task, it did not go according to plan due to some technical and health difficulties. However, I have tackled this task, "Bootstrap Portfolio," as best as possible. Both portfolios are works in progress, and I will revisit them to apply the levels of refinement they deserve as I learn more dos and don'ts.
