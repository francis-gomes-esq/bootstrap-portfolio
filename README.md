# Unit 3 Challenge: Code Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

I used Bootstrap to simplify responsive web design, aiming to enhance user experiences. The project addressed the challenge of consistency across devices, utilising Bootstrap's pre-built components and responsive grid system for efficiency. Through this, I learned to leverage Bootstrap effectively, gaining insights into mobile-first design principles. The experience highlighted the framework's practical application in modern web development, streamlining the design process.
